The Multipectal is a prototype to conduct photobiology experiments in a 24 well microplates that can apply individual light intensities at each well on na continuous and dynamic profile. Designed with affordability and scalability in mind, this innovative approach facilitates a wide range of experimental applications in photobiology and optogenetics.
